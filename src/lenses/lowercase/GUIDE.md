# Lowercase Lens - Student Guide

> Student-facing instructions for using the Lowercase lens

The Lowercase lens is a text transformation tool that doesn't require any interaction - it automatically processes your code when used.

## What It Does

The Lowercase lens takes any code and converts all letters to lowercase, creating a more uniform and standardized appearance while keeping everything else the same.

## No Interaction Required

This lens works automatically - you don't need to click anything or make any choices. Simply use it in your Study Lenses setup and it will transform your code.

## Future Interactive Features

_Currently, the Lowercase lens has no interactive components. This guide will be expanded when interactive features are added._

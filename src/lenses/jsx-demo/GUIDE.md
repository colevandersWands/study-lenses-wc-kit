# JSX Demo Lens - Student Guide

> How to use the interactive JSX Demo code analysis dashboard

The JSX Demo lens creates an interactive visual dashboard that shows you statistics about your code in a beautiful, easy-to-read format.

## What You'll See

When the JSX Demo lens runs, it creates a colorful dashboard with:

### üìä Statistics Cards

- **Lines**: How many lines of code you have
- **Words**: Total number of words in your code
- **Characters**: Total character count (including spaces)

Each statistic has its own colored card with large, easy-to-read numbers.

### üìù Interactive Code Preview

Click on "üìù Code Preview" to expand and see your full code in a nicely formatted display.

- **Expandable**: Click the arrow to show/hide your code
- **Formatted Display**: Code appears in a monospace font for easy reading
- **Scrollable**: Long code can be scrolled within the preview area

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Metadata Information

At the bottom of the dashboard, you'll see:

- **Language**: What programming language was detected (js, python, etc.)
- **Test Mode**: Whether this code appears to be a test file (ON/OFF)

## Using the Dashboard

### 1. Reading the Statistics

The three main cards give you a quick overview:

- **Green card (Lines)**: Shows total lines - helps gauge code length
- **Yellow card (Words)**: Shows word count - useful for complexity estimation
- **Red card (Characters)**: Shows total characters - helpful for size limits

### 2. Exploring Your Code

- **Click the "üìù Code Preview" section** to expand it
- **Read through your formatted code** in the preview area
- **Click again to collapse** when you're done reviewing

### 3. Understanding the Information

- **Small numbers**: Simple, concise code
- **Large numbers**: More complex or lengthy code
- **Test mode ON**: Your code includes testing functions like `describe()` or `test()`
- **Test mode OFF**: Regular application code

## What This Teaches You

The JSX Demo lens helps you learn about:

### Code Analysis

- **Size awareness**: Understanding how long your code is
- **Structure recognition**: Seeing patterns in line counts and word distribution
- **Complexity estimation**: More words often means more complex logic

### Code Organization

- **File types**: Distinguishing between regular code and test files
- **Language recognition**: Understanding how different languages are identified
- **Readability**: Seeing your code in a clean, formatted display

### Interactive Learning

- **Visual feedback**: Getting immediate visual information about your code
- **Exploration**: Being able to dig deeper by expanding sections
- **Pattern recognition**: Noticing how different code styles affect the statistics

## Best Practices

### When to Use JSX Demo

- **After writing new code**: Check the statistics to see your code's characteristics
- **Comparing code samples**: See how different approaches affect complexity metrics
- **Learning about file structure**: Understand the difference between test and regular files
- **Code review**: Get a quick visual overview before diving into details

### What to Look For

- **Balanced statistics**: Very high line counts with very low word counts might indicate formatting issues
- **Appropriate complexity**: More complex tasks should naturally have higher numbers
- **Clear code structure**: Well-organized code often shows consistent patterns in the statistics

## Interactive Features

### Expanding and Collapsing

The code preview section can be toggled open and closed:

- **Closed**: Shows just the title bar with a clickable arrow
- **Open**: Displays your full code in a scrollable, formatted view
- **Click anywhere** on the title bar to toggle between states

### Responsive Design

The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Wide screens**: Statistics appear side-by-side in a grid
- **Narrow screens**: Statistics stack vertically for easier reading
- **Code preview**: Always takes the full width for optimal code viewing

This lens demonstrates how modern web technologies like JSX and Preact can create rich, interactive learning experiences that make code analysis engaging and visually appealing.
